# Project Documentation

## Overview
Neph.nvim is a Neovim plugin for interactive code review using LLMs. It acts as an integration layer, providing terminal management, status bridging, and interactive diff reviews. It ensures agents do not interact with Neovim directly by using an intermediate policy and routing layer.

## Architecture

The system enforces a strict boundary where agents interact with the Cupcake policy layer, which invokes a CLI bridge to signal Neovim.

    C -->|Msgpack RPC| D[Neovim: neph.nvim vimdiff]
    D -->|RPC Response| C

```

## Key Flows

### Interactive Review Flow

This flow triggers when an agent proposes file modifications.

```mermaid

    participant A as Agent
    participant C as Cupcake
    participant NCLI as neph-cli
    participant NV as Neovim

    A->>C: Propose write/edit (Hook)
    C->>C: Evaluate policies (block rm -rf, protect .env)
    C->>NCLI: Run neph_review (normalize to path, content)
    NCLI->>NV: RPC review.open
    NV-->>NV: User reviews in vimdiff (ga/gr)
    NV->>NCLI: Return decision & content
    NCLI->>C: Signal result
    C->>A: Formatted response (accept/reject/partial)
```

## API Endpoints

The project uses a custom RPC protocol (`neph-rpc/v1`) between the `neph-cli` and Neovim over Unix sockets (`$NVIM`).

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `review.open` | Opens an interactive vimdiff review. Returns `{ decision, content, hunks, reason }`. |
| `review.status` | Retrieves the status of the current review. |
| `review.accept` | Accepts a specific hunk or the entire review. |
| `review.reject` | Rejects a specific hunk or the entire review. |
| `review.accept_all` | Accepts all hunks in the review. |
| `review.reject_all` | Rejects all hunks in the review. |
| `review.submit` | Submits the completed review. |
| `review.next` | Navigates to the next hunk or file in the review. |
| `status.set` | Sets a `vim.g` global variable. |
| `status.get` | Gets a `vim.g` global variable. |
| `status.unset` | Unsets a `vim.g` global variable. |
| `buffers.check` | Calls `:checktime` to sync files. |
| `tab.close` | Closes the current tab. |
| `ui.select` | Prompts the user to select an option from a list. |
| `ui.input` | Prompts the user for text input. |
| `ui.notify` | Displays a notification message to the user. |
| `tools.status` | Retrieves the status of installed tools. |
| `tools.install` | Installs a specific tool. |
| `tools.install_all` | Installs all available tools. |
| `tools.uninstall` | Uninstalls a specific tool. |
| `tools.preview` | Previews available tools. |
| `bus.register` | Registers an extension agent's RPC channel (Internal). |
